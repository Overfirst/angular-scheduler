# Angular scheduler

## What is this project?

This project is an attempt to recreate the functionality of the event scheduler, similar to Microsoft Outlook with some simplifications. Unlike the Microsoft version, here an annual presentation was added to the three existing views, which, as far as we know, has not been done by anyone before.

Angular 12 was used for the development.
